= PassiveRecord
by Jason L Perry (http://paint.itred.org)

== DESCRIPTION:
  
A replacement for ActiveRecord when you just need to model
a few unchanging objects, and don't necessarily need a full blown
ActiveRecord class and table in the database. Use with reservation.

== FEATURES:
  
* some basic ActiveRecord style finders
* dynamic attribute based finders, supporting basic comparisons as well
  regular expressions and ranges
* some integrated ActiveRecord associactions, ie: ActiveRecord#belongs_to(:passive_record)
  PassiveRecord#has_many(:active_records) (excluding has_many :through)
  
== TODOs:

* has_many :through
* extend find options like :conditions, :order
* find(:first) (depends on :order being implemented)
* better documentation of the code
* fix warnings in tests

== SYNOPSIS:

  class Continent < PassiveRecord::Base
    has_many :countries # => an ActiveRecord class
  
    schema :name => String,          :size => Integer,  :population => Integer
  
    create :name => "Africa",        :size => 30370000, :population => 890000000 
    create :name => "Antarctica",    :size => 13720000, :population => 1000
    create :name => "Australia",     :size => 7600000,  :population => 20000000
    create :name => "Eurasia",       :size => 53990000, :population => 4510000000
    create :name => "North America", :size => 24490000, :population => 515000000
    create :name => "South America", :size => 17840000, :population => 371000000
  end

  Continent.find(1)                                     # => Africa
  Continent.find_by_name("Africa")                      # => Yes, also Africa
  Continent.find_by_name_and_size(/America/, 17840000)  # => South America
  Continent.find_all_by_population(1000..20000000)      # => Antarctica and Australia
  Continent.find(:all)                                  # => All 6 (though not in any particular order, yet)
